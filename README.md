## Description

This app tracks everyone' ideas about hip hop culture! It functions as a reddit clone. After logging in/signing up, you can access the site and view posts/comments or create and delete your own. It stores everyone's posts and comments on the backend in API format with Ruby on Rails, and the front end was built with React.

## Install Instructions

Get repo
Clone to your local environment
Run by typing in 'rake start'!

## Usage
 After using npm start, the app should be easily navigatable! First log in/signup, then navigate around to view posts and comments! You can read comments all on one page, so if you have ideas/connections you want to make between threads, go ahead! We provide validations on the back end to ensure that everyone has a safe username/password combo, as well as the only functionality to delete their own work!
